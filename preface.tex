The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) model is a configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.  
This technical note describes the scientific and algorithmic approaches in the ARW Version 4, including 
its dynamical solver, physics options, initialization capabilities, boundary conditions, grid-nesting 
techniques, and data assimilation capabilities.  ARW is supported as a community model by the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research, facilitating system development and broad use for research, operations, 
and education. The modeling system supports atmospheric simulations across scales from large-eddy to 
global. ARW’s applications include real-time NWP, weather events and atmospheric-process studies, 
data assimilation development, parameterized-physics development, regional climate simulation, 
air quality modeling, atmosphere-ocean coupling, and idealized- atmosphere studies.

This particular version of the Tech Note covers ARW releases up to Version 4.1.
This document will be updated as new releases become available and new features are added to the model.
