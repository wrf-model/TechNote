The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) Model is a community 
atmospheric modeling system, and its development and capabilities 
are the result of the contributions of a host of individuals and 
institutions from over the years.  The features in ARW Version 4 
stem from this generous and collaborative approach and offer the community 
a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model reflecting 
advancements in meteorology, computational science, and
data assimilation.  Many people have worked on and provided 
features and improvements for this latest version, particularly in 
the areas of physics and dynamics, and the authors thank them for 
their contributions.

The effort to support and maintain ARW is led by the National Center for 
Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which is primarily supported by the National Science 
Foundation (NSF).  The authors sincerely thank NCAR and NSF for their support of 
the ARW effort.  During the development of Version 4, support 
in various forms has also been provided by: the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Defense, the
Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Department of Energy, and
the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan.
